text1 = """You find yourself in a flat plain with swaying green grass and massive oak trees scattered near and far into the distance.
As you look around, you see no signs of civilization, only plains as far as the eye can see. Behind you is a small hill with tall,
light green grasses and shrubs swaying in the light, wind. On the edge of the hill is a small, deteriorated platform with a double door going into it
You do not remember where you are or how you got here, but there is a weird sense of urgency, specifically regarding the doors going into the hill."""

text2 = """You move up to the small platform. It looks to be quartz, but its prime was long, long ago, vines are up and around it, and cracks flood the floor.
As you step up onto it, the bits and pieces of the steps crumble below your boots, and an eerie feeling falls upon you. You move near the door, but not too close,
and can see something etched into the top of it. They seem to be words long faded away, maybe of the name of this long-forgotten place."""

text3 = """You look around parts of the hill and surrounding area. All you find is grass and dirt. Climbing atop the hill brings nothing but a slightly better view
of the surrounding area, and shade from a small, young hickory tree. As far as you can see, there is no sign of civilization and only more plains.
You come to the conclusion that the platform may provide something as to why you are here."""

text4 = """You step down from the platform, bits and pieces crumbling off as you do, to see if anything about this place can be found nearby.
Around the hill is only grass and dirt and climbing atop the hill brings nothing but a view of the surrounding area, and shade from a small and young hickory tree.
As far as you can see, there is no sign of civilization and only more plains. You come to the conclusion that the platform may provide something as to why you are
here, and begin to walk towards it."""

text5 = """You walk up to the faded, but white double doors. Whatever mechanism used to open the door has long fallen off leading to a small hole you can see through,
although there is only darkness when you try to see into it. The eerie feeling continues but as this is the only way to find out what is happening,
you try to open the heavy seemingly long forgotten doors, and they barge right open, but you are unsure if this is due to them being old and having a broken lock or
because someone or something has unlocked it.
You dare not step into the room that is only lit by one faint torch, which you immediately see as being weird for such an old, seemingly abandoned structure,
but you can see from outside that after only a few units a staircase going down tempts you. Knowing there is nothing else to do you enter the room.
Right away a deep, musty smell invades your ears. You immediately realize just how old this place truly is. The walls and ceiling are of uneven dirt like
material while the floor is of stone, which is unsurprisingly cracked all along. The eerie feeling, also unsurprisingly, has gotten magnitudes worse but you
also know that you have to be here for a reason and are tempted to venture further into the unknown.
