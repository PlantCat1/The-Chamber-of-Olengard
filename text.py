text1 = """You find yourself in a flat plain with swaying green grass and massive oak trees scattered near and far into the distance.
As you look around, you see no signs of civilization, only plains as far as the eye can see. Behind you is a small hill with tall,
light green grasses and shrubs swaying in the light, wind. On the edge of the hill is a small, deteriorated platform with a double door going into it
You do not remember where you are or how you got here, but there is a weird sense of urgency, specifically regarding the doors going into the hill."""

text2 = """You move up to the small platform. It looks to be quartz, but its prime was long, long ago, vines are up and around it, and cracks flood the floor.
As you step up onto it, the bits and pieces of the steps crumble below your boots, and an eerie feeling falls upon you. You move near the door, but not too close,
and can see something etched into the top of it. They seem to be words long faded away, maybe of the name of this long-forgotten place."""
